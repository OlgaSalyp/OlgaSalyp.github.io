I’m Olga Y. Salyp, a neuroscientist. I was born and raised in Russia, conquering the peaks of the mountains and admiring the starry sky.

Currently, I am based at [Bordeaux Neurocampus](https://www.bordeaux-neurocampus.fr/) in France, where I am deeply involved in the "Analysis of microRNAs contained in exosomes secreted by neurons and astrocytes" project. Before joining Bordeaux Neurocampus, I dedicated four years (2019-2023) to the [Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology](https://ihna.ru/en/) in Russia, where I was focused on epilepsy research, working with electrophysiology. Also in the middle of the bachelor I did a summer internship in Israel.

I’m active in science popularisation and helping students, so I run a blog on Telegram called [NeuroLife](https://t.me/Sci_Neuro_Life) where I share insights about neuroscience and my life in France. I am the Project Manager of the [SciXplore](https://scixplore.ru/) project. Additionally, I frequently deliver lectures and master classes, both as part of formal mentoring programs and on a personal basis.

I’m best reached via email or telegram. I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
